<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stationary Air Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Displacement</li><li>Dynamic Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The stationary air compressor market is primarily categorized into two types: positive displacement and dynamic displacement compressors. Positive displacement compressors work by trapping a specific volume of air and compressing it, often seen in reciprocating and rotary screw designs. In contrast, dynamic displacement compressors utilize a rotating mechanism to impart velocity to the air, further converting that velocity into pressure, as seen in centrifugal compressors. Each type serves distinct industrial applications based on efficiency, pressure requirements, and operational characteristics.</p></p>
